The Strategy pattern is useful when we have multiple algorithms for performing a task
and we want to choose any of the algorithms at runtime. This pattern is especially good
when the number of algorithms increases because it isolates algorithms from the client code.

However, this design pattern complicates the system by adding multiple additional classes.
